I have been interested in data analysis for a little over a decade. Despite this, I worked in finance as a financial analyst and senior financial analyst for almost the past decade.
After so much time learning finance and exploring a career that, while educational, was not the right fit for me, I have decided to pursue my passion for data analytics.

Data is interesting to me because it encapsulates so much more than just money.
Instead of measuring operational efficiencies and their effect on the bottom line, data allows me to understand what is or is not driving those operational efficiencies and how to improve upon them.
Data is also wide-reaching, and it touches more areas of a business than just the financial statements. As someone with strong business acumen, I want to analyze entire businesses, not just the dollars and cents.

As a budding data analyst, my passion lies in writing code to extract business insights, and then communicating these insights to the relevant stakeholders to allow for better business decisions to be made.
I am new to writing SQL and Python, but I have a knack for coding, and I want to explore these skills further. Due to my background in finance, I am also adept at data visualization and report building.

This portfolio is to showcase my abilities as a new data professional. It includes SQL code, Python code, and Power BI dashboards/reports for data visualizations.

As someone looking to make a career change, this portfolio shows my readiness for a career in data to potential employers.
Whether they are looking for a data analyst that can write SQL, Python, or manipulate and visualize data in Power BI, this portfolio exhibits my skill in all three.

As the sole maintainer of this portfolio, I will update it with new displays of my aptitude as I continue learning new skills.
