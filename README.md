This portfolio is to showcase my abilities as a new data professional. It includes SQL code, Python code, and Power BI dashboards/reports for data visualizations.

As someone looking to make a career change, this portfolio shows potential employers my readiness for a career in data. 
Whether they are looking for a data analyst that can write SQL, Python, or manipulate and visualize data in Power BI, this portfolio exhibits my skill in all three.

As the sole maintainer of this portfolio, I will update it with new displays of my aptitude as I continue learning new skills.
