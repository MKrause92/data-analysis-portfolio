I have been interested in data analysis for a little over ten years. Over the past decade, I have worked in finance as a financial analyst and senior financial analyst.
After so much time learning finance and exploring a career that proved immensely educational, I decided to expand on my technical skill set to help elevate my career.

Data analytics is interesting to me because it encapsulates so much more than just money.
Instead of measuring operational efficiencies and their effect on the bottom line, data analysis allows me to understand the root cause behind what is driving those operational efficiencies and how to improve upon them, which then helps to inform their effect on the bottom line.
Data is also wide-reaching, and it touches more areas of a business than just the financial statements. As someone with strong business acumen, I want to analyze entire businesses and understand how data-driven decisions will impact businesses both financially and operationally.

As a seasoned financial analyst and budding data professional, my passion lies in writing code to extract business insights, and then communicating these insights to the relevant stakeholders to allow for better business and financial decisions to be made.
I have some experience writing SQL and Python, and I have a knack for coding, and I want to explore these skills further. Due to my background in finance, I am also adept at data visualization and report building.

This portfolio is to showcase my technical abilities and how they can be used in a data-enabled role on a finance or data analytics team. It includes various flavors of SQL code and Power BI dashboards/reports for data visualization, and it includes Python code for data manipulation, visualization, and beginner data science.

As someone looking to elevate their career, this portfolio shows my readiness for a more technical role within the field of finance or data analytics.
If companies are looking for an all-around analyst - financial or otherwise - with strong business acumen that can write SQL, Python, or manipulate and visualize data in Power BI, this portfolio will exhibit my skill in all three.

As the sole maintainer of this portfolio, I will update it with new displays of my aptitude as I continue learning new skills. The next addition to this portfolio will be more SQL flavors and potentially some work in Alteryx.
